Women Safety using Machine Learning
Introduction
This project is using Machine Learning to predict whether a given place in a given time is safe for a women to go. The datasets which we have collected is fed into the machine learning model to predict the outcome.

Features
The prediction is done based on various features(parameters) including but not limited to

Place
Zone
Time
People frequency
Bar availability
Police Station availability
Police frequency
Model
As of now we are trying to predict SAFE/UNSAFE which is logistic regression.
Future aspects 
1)In future we can connect it with google maps so can we get the user location at the time he/she login .
2)It helps in maintaining the proper data which surely helps the cope at the time of patrolling.
3)This platform can also work for women security -at the time of travelling women's can add their location and by using logistic regression our application will predict the place is safe or not and for how much time (if women 's location is found to be in the unsafe zone then a alert msg will be sent to the near by police station)
